    Create a void method called displayHighScorePosition

    You should display the players name along with a message like " managed to get into position <x> on the high score table".

    Create a 2nd method called calculateHighScorePosition, which accepts one argument only, the player score
    This method should return an int with the following values:
    1 if the score is >=1000
    2 if the score is >=500 and < 1000
    3 if the score is >=100 and < 500
    4 in all other cases

    Jen who scored 900,
    Jack who scored 400,
    James who scored 50
